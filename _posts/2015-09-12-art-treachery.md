Art Treachery is my entry to the <a href="http://itch.io/jam/britishlibrary">British Library Labs Crowdsourcing Game Jam</a>
In this game you are an art thief, sneaking into a museum with a very specific mission. Instructions on how to play can be found ingame. The game is unfinished but playable.

You could try to <a href="/play/art-treachery/">play Art Treachery in your browser</a> but it will probably run slowly or not at all (depending on your browser). So I recommend you download it.
