Kotlin Playground is my entry to the <a href="https://robovm.com/kotlin-contest/">RoboVM Kotlin Contest</a>.
It is a simple game for kids to play around with a dancing hippo and some bouncing balls. I'm using Kotlin, RoboVM and LibGdx. Unfortunately I have no Mac so I can't provide a IOs version but you can easily build it from source.
