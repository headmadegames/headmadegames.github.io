Thou common dog, didst thou disgorge thy glutton bosom?
Thou sanguine coward!
Thou cullionly fool-born vassal!
Thou bottle-ale rascal! 
Thou filthy bung!
Thou vicious mole of nature!
Thou crusty botch of nature!
Thou whoreson impudent embossed rascal!
Thou hath more [hair] than wit, and more [faults] than hairs, and more [warts] than faults.
Thou poisonous bunch-back'd toad!
Thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up!
Thou art baser than a cutpurse.
Thou art wither'd like an old apple-john.
Thou art a flesh monger, a fool, and a coward.
Thou art a very ragged Wart.
Thou art open to incontinency.
Thou art essentially a natural coward without instinct.
Degenerate and base art thou.
O illiterate loiterer!
Were I like thee I'd throw away myself.
Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune.
There's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine.
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen as you are toss'd with.
Rogue, thou hast liv'd too long.
Idol of idiot-worshippers!
The most [infectious] [pestilence] [upon] [thee]!
[Would thou wert] [clean enough] [to spit upon]!
Thy face is as a book, where men may read strange matters.
Thy mother is an insidious worm-ridden wench!
Thy jointress is an infectious scurvy-valiant strumpet!
Thy bones are hollow; impiety has mad a feast of thee.
Thy tongue outvenoms all the worms of Nile.
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
